# Utils project

The Utils project includes files used by the Prosumer project, the Manager project and the Simulator project of the Green Lean Electrics Project (https://github.com/Green-Lean-Electric). 
This project was created to have a cleaner code without duplicated code.

## Installation

Download and install Node.js version 12 or higher. Lower versions may not work due to advanced JavaScript features.  
Download and install on localhost MongoDB version 4 or higher. Default port should be 27017.

Clone all projects repositories (Simulator, Prosumer, Manager & Utils).
Inside each project run the following command:
```bash
npm install

This should install Node.js dependencies we have used throughout our application.
